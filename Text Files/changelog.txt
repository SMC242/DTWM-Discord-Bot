Still working on executeOnEvents

ExecuteOnEvents thread removed. 

Added main to pass in functions to the event loop and start all threads

Removed global variable botChannel to avoid deadlock

Added commandListener class
with methods: run, __init__, listening 
and attributes: commands, threads, loop

Added new commands to commandListener: help, close

Moved classes to separate file
to make navigation of the code easier

Known bugs: 
main thread dies randomly
